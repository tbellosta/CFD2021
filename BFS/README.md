# Incompressible Flow past a Backward Facing Step
Simulation of a incompressible flow past a BFS geometry. Geometry and inlet conditions are taken
from the work of Fessler & Eaton, ["Turbulence modification by particles in a backward-facing step
flow"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/turbulence-modification-by-particles-in-a-backwardfacing-step-flow/7CCEE8B4F7C6A3003434D4106D7D1E24#)
